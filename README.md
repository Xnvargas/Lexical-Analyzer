# Lexical-Analyzer
Part 1 of Compiler Project 
This project highlights the use of inheritance, pointers, refrences, loops and file reading using C++.
This is the first part of a 3-part project that will be done over the corse of this semester. 
All files used in this project besides my main.cpp and function.cpp files are not my own, and are only included as they have data refrenced in my code and are necessary to run the lexical analyzer function. Some test files will also be provided in order to show the program in action. It will be able to recognise IDs,STRINGS, and INTs present in the file, aswell as perform various actions depending on the command line arguments (-v,-consts,-ids).
